# # Exploring event data
#
# This script is a simple overview of how to load event data from
# sessions in a single animal.

# %% [markdown]
#
# We need to load some libraries to help us work with our data.
#
# pandas: A library for working with data in a table format. If you are
#         familiar with R, pandas is similar to the data.frame object.
# pathlib: A library for working with file paths.
# hvplot: A library for creating interactive plots. For static /
#         print-ready plots, or for more complex faceted data plots, the
#         seaborn and/or matplotlib libraries might be more appropriate.

# %%
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
import hvplot.pandas

#
# We can refer to a path on the filesystem either relative to the
# current location or absolutely. The path object below is expecting the
# "rawdata/sub-danger-ses-RR20.03" folder to be in the parent directory
# of the current location, with the events file inside it.
#
# We can break up long strings across lines be enclosing them in
# parentheses.
#
#Before running the next cell, ensure that you have copied your data
# (e.g. sub-angelina) into a folder called "rawdata" in the parent directory

#Let's get our hands on your mouse's operant conditioning data! The raw timestamped
#events are stored in a csv file (these have been extracted from the med-pc source files).

# %%

#specify your own mouse and session of interest here
events_fn = ('../rawdata/sub-danger/ses-RR20.03/'
             'sub-danger_ses-RR20.03_task-RR20_acq-A_events.csv')

# %%

# read the csv specified in the cell above and hold in in a variable called "events"
# We need to change the onset timestamps (which are just numbers reflecting seconds
# since the start of the session) into actual time (days, hours, mins)

events = pd.read_csv(events_fn)
events['onset'] = pd.to_timedelta(events['onset'], unit='s')
events = events.fillna(0.01).set_index('onset')
events

# %% [markdown]
#
# Next we want to calculate the rate of occurance of each event type
# across some rolling window of time (e.g. 30s).
#
# The events table here is labelled for discrete events. If we want to
# look at event rate at all times (including times there are not
# events), we need a continuous time series.

# %%

# We can convert event_id to an index
events.set_index('event_id', append=True)

# %% [markdown]
#
# The formatting below is just to make the "method chaining" clear and
# avoid excessively long lines. One could just write the first
# assignment as:
#
# ```python
# (events.set_index('event_id', append=True).unstack('event_id'))
# ```
#
# but it's much harder to read and quite possibly requires horizontal
# scrolling to read the whole line.
#
# We'll expand the method chaining line by line as an example.

# %%

# We can get a column for each event
(events.set_index('event_id', append=True)
 .unstack('event_id'))

# %%

# We can convert this now to a boolean truth table and remove the
# 'duration' label

(events.set_index('event_id', append=True)
 .unstack('event_id')
 .notna()
 .droplevel(0, axis=1))

# %%

# And now resample in continuous time
(events.set_index('event_id', append=True)
 .unstack('event_id')
 .notna()
 .droplevel(0, axis=1)
 .resample(pd.to_timedelta('0.01s'))
 .sum())

# %%

# Now we can calculate continuous event rates

(events.set_index('event_id', append=True)
 .unstack('event_id')
 .notna()
 .droplevel(0, axis=1)
 .resample(pd.to_timedelta('0.01s'))
 .sum()
 .rolling(pd.to_timedelta('30s'))
 .sum())
#  .rename(columns={'duration': 'rate'}))

# %%

# Finally stack the table back to long form data, assign it to a
# variable and give it a name.

event_rates = (
    events.set_index('event_id', append=True)
    .unstack('event_id')
    .notna()

#
# The event_rates table now has just a single column of data, the rate
# of the event in 30 second windows, with the type of event on the left
# as an index column. If we wanted to select out just the rate of mag
# entries, for example, we could use the `.loc` method.
#
# The loc method allows us to select data by label, with one entry for
# the row labels and one for the column labels of interest. In this
# case, because each row has two labels ('event_id' and 'onset'), we can
# use a `tuple` to select the rows. `slice(None)` matches any value in
# the column.

#  %%
event_rates.loc[('mag', slice(None)), :]

# %% [markdown]
#
# We can use the hvplot library to create an interactive plot of the
# data. the `by` argument separates out the data based on the specified
# column. In this case, we are separating the data by the event_id,
# giving us a new line for each event type.

#
# What if we wanted both acquisition sessions? We could load them into
# separate variables, or into a list of DataFrames. But we could also
# just load them into a single dataframe and identify each acquision
# session with an extra column.
#
# Let's write a small function that returns our events DataFrame given a
# filename.

# We can call the load_events function using our filename from earlier
# to test it.

# %%
load_events(events_fn)

# %% [markdown]
# Now we can use that function to load both acquisition sessions. Recall
# that we have acquisitions A and B.
#
# A Path object can be used to represent a folder on the filesystem.

# values by keywords.

# Now can we extend this to both pre-reversal and post-reversal
# sessions?
#
# If we don't want to manually enter all the filenames, we can use the
